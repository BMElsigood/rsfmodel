# Rate and State Friction Toolkit

This Python module enables modeling of frictional response to dynamic events
such as velocity steps and time dependent frictional healing. The rate and
state framework was laid out in Dieterich (1979), and furthered by Ruina(1983).
A summary article by Chris Marone (1998) provides a solid background.


### Examples of use

To use the toolkit, simply create an instance of the RateState class and set
the necessary parameters as shown below.
